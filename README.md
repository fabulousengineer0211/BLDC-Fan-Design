Designed a brushless DC fan running based on solar power using Solar Pv panel and 12 volt battery. In this project, I designed the complete schematic and PCB design using autodesk eagle software and used concept of gate driver MP6532, 3 phase inverter ,switching effect of MOSFET's and brushless dc motor. After all the software part, the testing of pcb and prototyping is done in the lab.
